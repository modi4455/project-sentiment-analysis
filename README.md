# project-sentiment-analysis
Fifth project for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
## Project Overview
This repository hosts code used in fifth project on deploying Neural Networks project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree.

The project involved deploying a RNN based sentiment analysis on movie reviews complete with publicly accessible API and a simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint. This project assumes that you have some familiarity with SageMaker.

## Getting started
Open the Sagemaker Project.ipynb in a Sagemaker notebook instance(ml.t2.medium, a cpu instance is covered in the free tier). Clone this repo into the notebook instance. The notebook consists of further technical details to guide you through the deployment. Run the notebook to your own sentiment analysis webapp.
